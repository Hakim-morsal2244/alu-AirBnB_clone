# AirBnB Clone - The Console

## Description
This is the first step in creating a clone of the AirBnB web app. In this part, we build a command interpreter that can create and manage the data models used by AirBnB.

## How to Start It
Run the command below to start the command-line interpreter:
```bash
./console.py

$ ./console.py
(hbnb) create User
(hbnb) show User 1234-5678-9012
(hbnb) update User 1234-5678-9012 email "mhakim@gmail.com"
(hbnb) destroy User 1234-5678-9012
(hbnb) quit
$
